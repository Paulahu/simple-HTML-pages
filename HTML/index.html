          <span>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley
            Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker
            who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift, who has said she has Scottish heritage, was
            named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin Kingsley Swift, who
            is an actor. Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm, which her father purchased from one of
            his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine
            Franciscan sisters, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family moved to a rented house in the
            suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High
            School.</span>

          <span>At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre
            Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later
            shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run
            around the block four times and daydream about everything." She spent her weekends performing at local
            festivals and events. After watching a She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record
            labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. She was rejected, however,
            because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to
            figure out a way to be different."</span>

          <span>When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to
            play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing "Lucky You". In 2003,
            Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift
            modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a
            Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels. After performing original songs
            at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to
            Nashville with her mother.</span>
